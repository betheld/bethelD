# Hey there! My name is Bethel and I am a full-stack developer.
### Born and raised in Boston, a proud Eritrean woman and I love to create. Being first generation born in the US, from an early age I had to (and still do) assist my parents in all things tech from phones to computers, in all of their functionality. This made my curiousity to understand and work with technology grow, so much so that I took the steps to become a software engineer. 

### Prior to that, I had experience in the caregiving, food, and retail industries, all of which I acquired skills that allow me to thrive in many different environments. I've learned that failure is part of the process, it's about being determind to find the solution, I strive to apply that mindset in everything I do, not just code.

### Many of my interests revolve around creativity and expressing personal style; from fashion, photography to music, I appreciate the beauty of it all. As a developer, one thing I always keep in mind is the consumer, because I *AM* a consumer. It is easy to overlook things we as developers find simple to use that end up make user experience more challenging than it needs to be, or so focused on functionality that we neglect the visual aspect of our projects. Both are equally important and I look forward to the rest of my journey of creating meaningful **AND** beautiful technology.
